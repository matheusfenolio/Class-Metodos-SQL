# SQLMethods Class

Welcome to my personal project. This is a simple class to help everyone connect to databases with the connection string in a really easy way.
With it you can connect in Sql Server, MySql and Oracle, Just replacing some fields.
You can use it whatever and anywhere you want. But please, give me some credits :smiley:
